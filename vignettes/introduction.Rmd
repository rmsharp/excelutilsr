## Introduction
The goal of __excelutilsr__ is to provide some basic utility functions for
working
with Excel workbooks and worksheets. It does not particularly contain anything
novel, though, to my best knowledge it has the most complete function,
__add_formatted_worksheet__, for adding conditional styles to cells using
__XLConnect__. 

I use __create_wkbk__, which creates workbooks and one or more
worksheets, far more than any other function, because
many of my clients want output in Excel format.

I will continue to add functions to this when I develop something of general 
use.

Use the code as you want. Please send me any useful changes and enhancements
via a pull request on _github.com_.
